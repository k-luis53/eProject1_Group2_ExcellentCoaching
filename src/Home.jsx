                                <p>Excellent Coaching is into business for more than a decade. We have been
                                    advertising about their coaching classes through newspapers, pamphlets, television.
                                    Now with changing times, they have decided to go online as most of the students
                                    today are frequent users of Internet. They have planned for a website with complete
                                    details about the Coaching classes.</p>
